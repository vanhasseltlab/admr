# admr: Aggregate Data Modeling in R

admr (Aggregate Data Modeling in R) is an open-source R package designed to facilitate pharmacometric modeling using summary-level data. 
It enables users to work with aggregate data, such as mean observations and variance-covariance matrices, to fit pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models efficiently. 
This package implements a newly developed Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to enhance computational performance and provides tools for advanced modeling applications.
