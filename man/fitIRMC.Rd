\arguments{
\item{opts}{A list of model options generated by \code{genopts()}. Contains settings for the model,
including the prediction function, time points, parameter structure, and simulation
settings.}

\item{obs}{Observed data in aggregate form (mean and covariance) or as a matrix of raw data.}

\item{maxiter}{Maximum number of iterations for the optimization algorithm. Default is 100.}

\item{convcrit_nll}{Convergence criterion for the negative log-likelihood. The algorithm stops
when the relative change in negative log-likelihood is less than this value.
Default is 1e-05.}

\item{single_dataframe}{Logical indicating whether to use a single data frame (TRUE) or multiple
data frames (FALSE). Default is TRUE.}

\item{phase_fractions}{Vector of fractions for each optimization phase. The sum should be 1.
Default is c(0.2, 0.4, 0.2, 0.2).}

\item{max_worse_iterations}{Maximum number of consecutive worse iterations before skipping a phase.
Default is 10.}

\item{chains}{Number of parallel chains to run. Default is 1.}

\item{pertubation}{Perturbation factor for the initial parameter values of each chain.
Default is 0.1.}

\item{seed}{Random seed for reproducibility. Default is 1.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{fitIRMC_result} containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{p}: List of parameter estimates for each iteration
\item \code{nll}: Negative log-likelihood values
\item \code{time}: Computation time for each iteration
\item \code{iter}: Iteration number
\item \code{chain}: Chain number (if multiple chains are used)
\item \code{phase}: Optimization phase number
}
}
\description{
\code{fitIRMC} implements the Iterative Reweighting (IRMC) algorithm for parameter estimation of
aggregate data models, iterating over maximum likelihood updates with weighted Monte Carlo
updates. This function uses nloptr instead of optimx for optimization and includes additional
features like multiple chains and phase-based optimization.
}
\details{
The function uses the Iterative Reweighting algorithm with Monte Carlo sampling for optimization.
It includes several advanced features:
\itemize{
\item Multiple optimization phases with different convergence criteria
\item Parallel chains with perturbed starting values
\item Phase-based optimization with automatic phase skipping
\item Convergence checking based on both likelihood and parameter stationarity
}

The optimization process is divided into phases, each with its own convergence criteria and
settings. The algorithm can automatically skip phases if the optimization is not progressing.
Multiple chains can be run in parallel to improve the chances of finding the global optimum.

# Create test data
test_data <- create_test_data()

obs <- test_data$obs

# Run optimization with default settings
result <- fitIRMC(opts, obs)

# Run optimization with multiple chains
result <- fitIRMC(opts, obs, chains = 3)
