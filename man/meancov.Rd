\title{Compute mean and covariance of a matrix}
\usage{
meancov(m, wt)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{A numeric matrix or data frame containing the observations.
Each row represents an individual, and each column represents a time point.
For pharmacometric data, columns typically represent concentration measurements
at different time points.}

\item{wt}{Optional vector of weights for each observation. If not provided,
all observations are weighted equally. Weights can be used to account for
different sample sizes or reliability of different data sources.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{E}: Vector of means for each time point (population typical values)
\item \code{V}: Covariance matrix representing the variability between individuals
}
}
\description{
\code{meancov} computes the mean and covariance of a matrix, optionally with weights.
This function is used to convert raw data into aggregate form (mean and covariance)
for use in aggregate data modeling.
}
\details{
The function computes:
\itemize{
\item The mean of each column (time point) using \code{colMeans} for unweighted data
or weighted means for weighted data
\item The covariance matrix using \code{cov.wt} with maximum likelihood estimation,
which provides unbiased estimates of the population covariance
}

The maximum likelihood estimation method is used because:
\itemize{
\item It provides unbiased estimates of the covariance matrix
\item It is appropriate for aggregate data modeling where we want to estimate
population parameters
\item It handles both balanced and unbalanced designs through optional weights
}

Key features:
\itemize{
\item Handles missing data automatically through the underlying \code{cov.wt} function
\item Provides numerically stable computations
\item Can be used with both raw PK data and simulated data
\item Supports weighted calculations for meta-analysis or combined analysis
}

# Load required libraries
library(admr)
library(rxode2)

# Create a matrix of concentration measurements
# 10 subjects measured at 10 time points
m <- matrix(rnorm(100), nrow = 10, ncol = 10)

# Compute unweighted mean and covariance
# Useful for single-study analysis
result <- meancov(m)

# Compute weighted mean and covariance
# Useful for meta-analysis or when combining studies
weights <- runif(10)  # weights could represent study sizes
result_weighted <- meancov(m, weights)
