\title{Compute mean and covariance of a matrix}
\usage{
meancov(m, wt)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{A numeric matrix or data frame containing the observations.
Each row represents an individual, and each column represents a time point.}

\item{wt}{Optional vector of weights for each observation. If not provided,
all observations are weighted equally.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{E}: Vector of means for each time point
\item \code{V}: Covariance matrix of the observations
}
}
\description{
\code{meancov} computes the mean and covariance of a matrix, optionally with weights.
This function is used to convert raw data into aggregate form (mean and covariance)
for use in aggregate data modeling.
}
\details{
The function computes:
\itemize{
\item The mean of each column (time point) using \code{colMeans}
\item The covariance matrix using \code{cov.wt} with maximum likelihood estimation
}

If weights are provided, they are used in both the mean and covariance calculations.
The function uses maximum likelihood estimation for the covariance matrix, which
is appropriate for aggregate data modeling.
}
\examples{
# Create a matrix of observations
m <- matrix(rnorm(100), nrow = 10, ncol = 10)

# Compute mean and covariance without weights
result <- meancov(m)

# Compute mean and covariance with weights
weights <- runif(10)
result_weighted <- meancov(m, weights)
